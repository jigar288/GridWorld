# GridWorld


C++ project called Grid World keeps track of worldâ€™s information. For this project, I was able to improve from a slower quadratic read/write runtime to a much faster constant runtime by using combination of data structures (queues, doubly linked lists, multidimensional dynamic arrays, and vectors). Source code is protected and can be provided for valid reasons.
